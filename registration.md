- Registration will be first-come, first-served.
- This yearâ€™s competition is strictly in-person; we are unfortunately not accommodating any virtual teams.
- Our capacity is 35 teams, with up to 3 teams per school.
- Any teams registering after the first 35 teams will be placed on a waitlist.
- Registration fees will be $50 per TEAM (not school).
- We ask that teams who have already registered please fill out the form again as well so we have a complete record. You will be given priority in registration so you will be guaranteed a spot.
- In order to allow more teams to be able to participate, we will be releasing a financial need based scholarship form to waive the registration fees for schools who qualify.
As always, please feel free to reach out with questions or concerns at cmuscioly@gmail.com.
